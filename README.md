# File Reader
## Getting Started ðŸš€

Download and run `npm install`

### Scripts 
In order to format and print files run `node fileReader.js [text file]`

Try running `node fileReader.js space.txt`

Test with `npm test`

### Version Requirements
Node.js >= 14.0.0

#### Future improvements
Future iterations would abstract `fileReader.js` into a class with method called `readFromCommandLine()` that accepts the file as the argument. This would allow easy testing and reusability.
